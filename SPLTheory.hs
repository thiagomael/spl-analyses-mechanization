{- *****ASSUMPTION to be encoded in PVS: 

   alpha (partialModelComposition pm1 pm2 ) = partialExpComposition (alpha pm1) (alpha pm2) 
   
   Essentially, this means that alpha is compositional. In other words, alpha is a monophormism between Product and Property,
   where the respective partial compositions preserve alpha. This might be interpreted intuitively, since the left-hand side
   deals with compositional analysis, whose definition on the compositional model maps hatAlpha on the the underlying functor,
   and hatAlpha is based on alpha.
   
   *** Hint: The aforementioned assumption will most likely be needed to prove the commutativity of the upper-left quadrant 
             (feature-product x product). As discussed in the meeting, we will also probably need the 
			 previous result (commutativity of family-product x product). This situation is similar to Theorem 5 in the 
			 concrete theory and its proof. So the proof of the commutativity of the upper-left quadrant could proceed 
			 by structural induction on the compostional model along the well-founded relation. In the base, case the 
			 compositional model amounts to just the top,  so analyzeCM will rewrite to hatAlpha. Then, using the
             previous result (commutativity of the top-right quadrant), the proof concludes.  In the inductive step,
			 we could additionally  use the aforementioned assumption.
