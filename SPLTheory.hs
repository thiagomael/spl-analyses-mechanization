-- The purpose of this theory is to model the essential concepts and behavior regarding
-- analysis of non-variable and variable models. We first present definitions regarding 
-- non-variable models, then definitions for variable ones. 
-- Ultimately, we aim at deriving the latter from the former.

------ Non-variable definitions

-- A non-variable model is an uninterpreted type abstracting the details of any particular product type
data Product = SomeProduct;

data Property = SomeValue deriving Eq

-- To analyze a non-variable model, we return some uninterpreted value since the analysis is given
-- In other words, since the non-variable  model is uninterpreted, so is its analysis.

alpha _  = SomeValue

-- a presence condition is a feature expression, yet to detail
data PresenceCondition = SomeCondition deriving Eq

-- A configuration values a presence condition 
type Conf = PresenceCondition -> Bool  

-- A variable model is either a non-variable model or a variation point with choices depending on an option,

-- In case the model has no variability, the base model is returned. Otherwise, in case of a variation point,
-- the derivation continues within the choice corresponding to the configuration.

{- ASSUMPTION to be encoded in PVS: 
 
   hatAlpha (partialModelComposition m1 m2 ) = partialExpComposition (hatAlpha m1) (hatAlpha m2)
   
   The assumption establishes an hatAlpha as an isophorfism between AnnotativeModel and AnnotativeExpression
   in which the respective morphisms involve the partial composition operations. In short, the assumption is
   that partial composition of models and expressions must preserve the correspondence between models and 
   expressions established by the analysis function. This will probably by needed in the proof of the commuitative property for this quadrant.
   Hint: the definitions of pi' and sigma' below are quite similar
